<h2>What to draw</h2>
<p>Please use your mouse to mark the areas of the image that belong to the
<b>specified part of the central person</b> with foreground lines and the rest
with background lines</p>

<p>The specified part name (you can find it in the yellow top line) is named as
if you were the person. So if the task is to mark the left arm then imagine you
are the person in the image and mark your left arm. Little red dots
additionally are drawn onto the specified part.</p>

<p>Please, mark only those areas of the image where you can actually see the
specified part.</p>

<p>Everything that a person wears should be included with the person. All other
things -- including sports gear like bats, balls -- that you would not count as
a cloth should not be included. See some examples below.</p>

<p>Add more scribbles with the use of your mouse until only parts of the image
appear brighter that belong to the specified part of the central person.
Person scribbles are shown as solid blue lines and non-person scribbles as
solid green lines.</p>

<p>Please work on all images to be able to submit the task.</p>

<h2>How to draw</h2>
<p>Click and hold your <b>left</b> mouse button to produce a line that marks
part of the image that belong to the <b>inside</b> of a part of the person.
Release the button to stop drawing.</p>

<p>Use the <b>right</b> button to mark <b>outside</b> parts.</p>

<p>Wait for a moment after each line until the display is updated. Add more
scribbles until only parts of the image containing the specified part of the
central person appear brighter.</p>

<h2>Switch mask on/off to see better</h2>
<p>By pressing T or the button &quot;Hide/Show Mask&quot; you can switch the
mask on and off. Sometimes this makes it easier to see the inside and the
outside of the central person.</p>

<p>You can add scribbles no matter if the mask is switched on or off.</p>
