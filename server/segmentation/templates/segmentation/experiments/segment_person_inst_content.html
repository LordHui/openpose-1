<h2>What to draw</h2>
<p>Please use your mouse to mark the part of the image that belong to the
<b>central person</b> with foreground lines and the rest with background
lines</p>

<p>Everthing that a person wears should be included with the person. All other
things -- including sports gear like bats, balls -- that you would not count as
a cloth should not be included. See some examples below.</p>

<p>Add more scribbles with the use of your mouse until only parts of the image
appear brighter that belong to the central person. Person scribbles are shown
as solid blue lines and non-person scribbles as solid green lines.</p>

<p>Please work on all images to be able to submit the task.</p>

<p>Scribble to complete the task.</p>

<h2>How to draw</h2>
<p>Click and hold your <b>left</b> mouse button to produce a line that marks
part of the image that belong to the <b>inside</b> of the person. Relase the
button to stop drawing.</p>

<p>Use the <b>right</b> button to mark <b>outside</b> parts.</p>

<p>Wait for a moment after each line until the display is updated. Add more
scribbles until only parts of the image containing the central person appear
brighter.</p>

<h2>Switch mask on/off to see better</h2>
<p>By pressing T or the button &quot;Hide/Show Mask&quot; you can switch the
mask on and off. Sometimes this makes it easier to see the inside and the
outside of the central person.</p>

<p>You can add scribbles no matter if the mask is switched on or off.</p>
